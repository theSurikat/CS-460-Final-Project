This is the github for our group project. We all worked together to learn about security in a variety of ways. Yung and Everett were working on bluetooth related applications, while Chen and Allen worked at more machine oriented security. A common theme to all of these is about normal people being attacked to protecting themself. We all wanted to work on a project that could impact us in some way. 

These applications can be combined in fact. With the use of Everett's invasion tool we could find a computer that had downloaded our keylogger. Using the information from our keylogger we can break into the device, and upload Yung and Allen's applications. Allen's will protect our processes from trashing which could be a way to detect malware. Yung's application will be able to decrypt bluetooth packets. With a bit of addition we could be sending those to a server and steal all of a person's music.

This is an example usage of all of these but there are a vareity of other usages. Primarily this was a good way for all of us to see a bit of something we hadn't. Everett had worked with bluetooth before but seeing Allen's application helped him understand kernel modules. Chen's keylogger was a good learning experience for a number of us to understand something that is often the basis of attacks.

Hope you enjoy this project.
